# ðŸ§¾ðŸª™ Flutter Expense Management App

**Developed by Fredy and Isaac**

A simple Flutter app to manage expenses. A pet project to improve skills and learn new features.
I had several technical tasks:

## âš¡ Tasks
1. Due to given UI kit create prototype describing all features.
2. Add translations (ukr, eng).
3. Authentication should be on user's device with the usage of biometrics if supported. Otherwise use pin code.
4. All data should be stored locally in SQlite DB.
5. Despite all data is stored locally, implement multiuser feature.
6. Use freezed and json_serializable packages for for data-classes and pattern-matching.

## âš¡ Features
- [x] All data stored on user's device.
- [x] Create notes of user's income and expense.
- [x] Count balance from the first note to the selected period.
